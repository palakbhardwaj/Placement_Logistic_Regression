## Machine Learning Pipeline for Predicting Placement

This document outlines the steps involved in a machine learning pipeline to predict placement using logistic regression.

### Steps

1. **Preprocess + EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) + Feature Selection**
   - Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform other necessary cleaning tasks.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between features.
   - Select relevant features based on the EDA findings and domain knowledge.

2. **Extract Input and Output Columns**
   - Extract the input features (independent variables) and output column (dependent variable) from the dataset.
   ```python
   X = df[['cgpa', 'iq']]  # Example feature columns
   y = df['placement']     # Example target column
   ```

3. **Scale the Values**
   - Scale the input features using a standard scaler to normalize the data.
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
   ```

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

5. **Train the Model**
   - Train a logistic regression model using the training data.
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

   clf = LogisticRegression()
   clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model/Model Selection**
   - Evaluate the trained model using the testing data and calculate the accuracy score.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

   y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
   ```

7. **Deploy the Model**
   - Save the trained model to a file for deployment.
   ```python
   import pickle

   with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
       pickle.dump(clf, file)
   ```

### Additional Visualization

- Visualize the scatter plot of 'cgpa' vs 'iq' colored by 'placement'.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df['cgpa'], df['iq'], c=df['placement'])
plt.xlabel('CGPA')
plt.ylabel('IQ')
plt.title('CGPA vs IQ Colored by Placement')
plt.show()
```

### Files

- `model.pkl`: Saved trained logistic regression model.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Instructions

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Follow the steps outlined above to preprocess the data, train, and evaluate the model.
3. Use the provided code snippets as needed.
4. Run the script to train the model and save it to `model.pkl`.
5. Use `model.pkl` for making predictions on new data.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and code required to build, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model for predicting placement.
